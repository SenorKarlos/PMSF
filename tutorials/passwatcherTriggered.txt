## How to connect passwatcher with PMSF-Leevo ##
################################################
This is a quick howto for what the passwatcher is used for and how to use it properly

Check out the github repository to set up the passwatcher:
https://github.com/ccev/passwatcher

What the connection between passwatcher and pmsf-leevo does:
the passwatcher will take the gym ids which are triggered to have passes and enters those in the
static/data/triggeredgyms.json
With that data, the Map will show these gyms with a golden EX automatically without adding it to the $triggerGyms from the config.
Result: A fully automated creation of all triggered Gyms so you dont need to put all gym ids into $triggerGyms anymore.

To set it up:
1) copy the triggeredgyms.json.template and rename it to triggeredgyms.json
	Copy and paste command if you are in the pmsf folder:
	cp static/data/triggeredgyms.json.template static/data/triggeredgyms.json
2) Set up passwatcher properly
3) In the passwatcher configs, enable the pmsf-leevo in the config and apply your path to the static/data/triggeredgyms.json correctly.
4) enable $passwatcherTriggeredGyms in the config
5) have fun with automated triggered gyms display :)
